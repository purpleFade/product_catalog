# Project Description:

The project is a web application for internet mobile store developed using React with TypeScript, Redux for state management, and SCSS for styling. It is designed to showcase and manage a list of products, fetching data from a RESTful API.

## Technologies Used:

 - React with TypeScript: The front-end of the application is built using React, with TypeScript providing static typing for a more robust development experience.

 - Redux: Redux is employed for state management, ensuring a predictable and centralized state for the application, particularly useful when dealing with complex data flow.

 - SCSS: Styling is done using SCSS (Sass), a popular preprocessor scripting language for CSS. SCSS allows for more maintainable and organized stylesheets.

 - RESTful API: The application communicates with a RESTful API to fetch product data.
